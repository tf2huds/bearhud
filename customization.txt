###RESOLUTION###
If you play on 4:3 aspect ratio, install bearhud_final first then copy the resource folder within 4x3 and paste it onto the resource folder in bearhud_final
If you play on 16:10 aspect ratio, install bearhud_final first then copy the resource folder within 16x10 and paste it onto the resource folder in bearhud_final

###CROSSHAIR###
To enable custom crosshairs find hudcrosshairs.res in /bearhud_final/scripts/, pick the crosshair of your liking and change the visible value to 1

###SCOREBOARD###
To enable 32p scoreboard (default 24p) find scoreboard_32.res in /bearhud_final/resource/ui/ and remove _32 from the name
Thanks elso for the edit!

###VIEWMODEL###
To enable transparent viewmodels find "TransparentViewmodelMask" at the top of hudlayout.res located in /bearhud_final/scripts/ and change the visible/enabled values to 1
This requires your game run on DirectX9 and the following settings. I recommend putting these in your autoexec.cfg:

// Transparent ViewModels
mat_motion_blur_enabled 1
mat_motion_blur_strength 0
mat_disable_bloom 1
mat_hdr_level 0
mat_colcorrection_disableentities 1
mat_colorcorrection 0
// Transparent ViewModels

###DAMAGE NUMBERS###
As of March 28th damage numbers color resets to red for most people on startup due to the new color slider in advanced settings
Add this to your autoexec.cfg to prevent this from happening:

hud_combattext_red 255
hud_combattext_green 255
hud_combattext_blue 255
