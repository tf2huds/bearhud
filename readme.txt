- Minor tweaks
- Restored most of the matchmaker menu to its original state
- New class menu (removed resolution fixes as it no longer breaks)

*New entry to customization.txt

Add this to your autoexec to prevent this from happening:

hud_combattext_green 255
hud_combattext_blue 255

This hud is my personal edit of broeselhud_blue, so every modification done to it has been arranged to my preferences (sometimes feedback). 
Thanks for checking out. Don't forget to leave feedback or questions in case something isn't working for you.
